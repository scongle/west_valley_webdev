                <h3>The good list of alien novels</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Infected Trilogy by Scott Sigler
                        <p>Sigler has become a favourite of mine in recent years and his Infected trilogy went a long way towards cementing this. This one begins with an infection that starts spreading across the world, causing some pretty messed up body horror. I suppose it's a bit of a spoiler to mention that it's alien of origin, but given its place at the top of this list I feel that's a little unavoidable and it'd be pretty difficult to go in blind at the best of times. One other thing I love about Sigler is the speed of his writing. No fancy prose, no getting bogged down with character studies. Just plot and action all at breakneck speed.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>The Touch by Brian Lumley
                        <p>This is a spinoff from Lumleys more famous Necroscope saga. While you'd benefit from having read the rest of the series, I'd say it's still standalone enough to be read without the rest, and in that case I think it's very deserving of its place so high on the list. You've got a main character with various special abilities who finds himself pitted against a trio of sadistic aliens with rather insane powers of their own. They can alter anything they touch, which can be used for good, but also for great sadistic evil - such as literally turning people inside out or seeding them with cancer. Their goal is to be so evil that they prove the existence of God by forcing him to stop them. Great pulpy fun from the master of the genre.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>Contest by Matthew Reilly
                        <p>Intergalactic Hunger Games pretty much sums this up in a nutshell. An unwitting human is drawn into a death game as the representative of our species where he has to somehow not only survive, but win against a cadre of other far more powerful and sadistic aliens. It's very action-filled and never a dull moment.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>The Border by Robert McCammon
                        <p>Ever see that show Falling Skies from about a decade ago? Well this is almost beat for beat a novelisation of that. Two warring species of aliens bring their fight to Earth and humans suffer the apocalyptic consequences. The story kicks off with a kid who wakes up with no memories. He soon discovers he's not a normal human boy, and this is the hook that kicks things off for the human resistance.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>The Sentience by SJ Patrick
                        <p>I frequently recommend Exhumed by Patrick and one of the things I love most about it is that it feels like an homage to Necroscope by Lumley. Similarly, The Sentience feels very much like an homage to Lumley once again, both Necroscope and The Touch above. The main character has some special abilties and a sadistic alien lands on earth. This one is a bit more of a cat and mouse story, with the alien desiring to capture/possess the MC and him needing to find a way to fight back against a being with seemingly insurmountable powers.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>Earthcore Duology by Scott Sigler
                        <p>Similar to Infected by Sigler, it's kind of a spoiler to even include it on the list, but it's not going to harm your enjoyment. The story is about a mining company who finds a gigantic platinum deposit in the desert worth billions of dollars. It's deep in the subsurface and they get digging, only they find that it appears to be guarded by something... Typical Sigler in the best kind of ways. Fast, fun, and no time to breathe.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>The Tommyknockers by Stephen King
                        <p>It always makes me sad that this book gets memed upon, often by people who have never even read it. It stems from King saying he was on so much coke that he doesn't even remember writing it. But the thing is... coke King was best King. This is a great story of a slow alien invasion, almost similar in a lot of ways to Salem's Lot. The main character trips over a shiny object in the forest before realising it's something far more. She becomes obsessed and starts to excavate it, which leads to its influence spreading and taking over the town. If you've avoided it based on reputation then do yourself a favour and give it a go.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>The Hematophages by Stephen Kozeniewski
                        <p>The second indie on the list after The Sentience above (could even say third, since Contest was self-pubbed before he later got picked up by a publisher and became famous). This one is basically The Thing but in space. A novelisation of Among Us. I don't say this is a bad way, it's a lot of fun. It's just the best way to describe what to expect and if you're looking for that kind of thing then look no further.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>Stinger by Robert McCammon
                        <p>I've been comparing many books here with movies and the one I'll compare this one to is Predator. You've got this teched up alien who lands in a small town with a mission to kill another alien in hiding. The town gets dragged into the shenanigans and everything goes from there. Pulpy and fun, enough said.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>The Midwich Cuckoos by John Wyndham
                        <p>Wyndham is one of my favourite authors, and similarly one of my favourite genres is characters with powers (hence a few of the other titles above). This one is about an alien invasion that results in an entire town of women being spontaneously impregnated. All of these women inevitably give birth, but it quickly becomes clear that their babies are not fully human. They grow into kids and their powers begin to flourish. As with much of what Wyndham writes, he delves into some rather uncomfortable morals and ethics and what should be done for the greater good.</p>
